# Hotel-Menu-Card
I created this project using HTML-CSS. I hope you will like this one!!
So, I used HTML for the texts and the images. I added the images using <img> tag. 
For the desining such as adding background colors and changing the font size and font styles, I used CSS.
You can feel free to make any changes to make the project better
